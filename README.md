# IT-Labs
A Collection of Hands-on IT Labs I've been working on to strengthen my skills and showcase what I'm capable of
- Virtual Lab Setup – Deploying Windows Server, Windows 10, and Kali Linux in Oracle VirtualBox as the foundation for future labs.
- Network Security Lab – Hardening SSH, configuring firewalls, DNS filtering, and securing wireless access.
- Network Monitoring & Troubleshooting Lab – Using Wireshark, Nmap, IP Scanner, and Windows tools to validate connectivity and services.
